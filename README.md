# Fuzzy Logic Compatibility Estimation for the Computer Science Career

Fuzzy logic, in a web app, evaluating how much compatibility a person has with the computer science career.

* Set of fuzzy partitions attribute weight to different characteristics and preferences in a person;
* Fuzzy rules combine the different traits to define membership functions;
* The app user can set 6 different variables considering his skills and traits:
    1. Math affinity;
    2. Interpersonal skills;
    3. Code writing affinity;
    4. Leadership skills;
    5. Study affinity;
    6. Communication skills.
* The fuzzy system is shown on the interface with membership functions for each characteristic;
* User can see the final membership functions and a red line showing his estimated level of compatibility with the computer science career.

A sample from the user interface can be seen next:

Fuzzy membership functions are made transparent as well, so that users can understand better the compatibility estimation:

*[Shiny] is a framework that allows users to develop web apps using R and embedded web languages, such as CSS and HTML. Shiny apps focus on objectiveness and simplicity: only one or two R scripts have all the code for the app.*

*This app development started with knowledge and tools discussed during the course "Data Science Bootcamp" by Fernando Amaral. The app has been upgraded and personalized, adding new functionalities.*
